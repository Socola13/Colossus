[Hibiki][1] is an easy, customizable, and powerful Discord bot that does anything that your server needs. Powered by [Node.js][2] and [Eris][3], it's written to be simple and easy to understand, but not sacrificing any powerful features.

You can invite the main application [here][4]. Any other instances of Hibiki are **not official** and could possibly carry privacy/security risks. The only official bot is `Hibiki#1448 (493904957523623936)`.
